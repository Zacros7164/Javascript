jQuery is a Javascript Library
that means jQuery IS Javascript
jQuery CANNOT live without js

jQuery allows you to change stuff, but doesn't keep track of the changes
in a big app.... this gets CONFUSING!!!!!
React, Angular, and Vue are the answer to this problem

jQuery directly manipulates the DOM
This is expensive - takes a lot of resources
React and others use a "virtualDOM" which is efficient


line 1- a $ means I'm writing JS, but not just any JS, I'm writing jQuery

line 3- targeting stuff
    native JS-
        document.getElementByTagName('div')
        document.getElementsByClassName('container')
        document.querySelector('.container')

    jQuery-
        $('.container)
        uses querySelector/CSS rules to traverse the DOM
        $('#row p')

line 11- 
    jQuery targets with CSS rules
    jQuery adds listeners as methods, i.e. click = .click()


line 31- 
    .css takes a JS Object
    key is a string for any CSS property
    value is what you want to apply


line 55- 
    fade toggle is the same as toggle but it adds an animated fade
    arg 1 is number of ms
